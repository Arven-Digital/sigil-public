## 1. Agreement

By accessing or using Sigil Protocol ("Service"), operated via sigil.codes, app.sigil.codes, and api.sigil.codes, you agree to these Terms. If you don't agree, don't use the Service.

The Service is operated by an individual developer ("Operator"), not a corporation.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least **18 years old** to use Sigil Protocol. By using the Service, you represent that you meet this requirement.

## 3. What Sigil Protocol Is

Sigil Protocol is an **AI-powered wallet security platform** on the Avalanche blockchain. It provides:

- Smart contract wallets (ERC-4337 account abstraction)
- AI-powered transaction evaluation (3-layer guardian system)
- Social recovery mechanisms
- DeFi whitelist bundles

## 4. Experimental Software — Use at Your Own Risk

**This is experimental software.** By using Sigil Protocol, you acknowledge and accept that:

- **Smart contracts may contain bugs.** They are deployed on-chain and may be immutable. No audit guarantees absolute security.
- **AI evaluations are not infallible.** The guardian system may incorrectly approve or reject transactions. It does not constitute financial advice.
- **Funds may be lost.** Through software bugs, smart contract vulnerabilities, blockchain issues, user error, or circumstances beyond anyone's control.
- **No guarantees are made** regarding uptime, accuracy, reliability, or security of any part of the Service.

**The Operator accepts NO liability for any loss of funds, failed transactions, incorrect AI evaluations, or any damages arising from use of the Service.**

## 5. No Financial Advice

Nothing in Sigil Protocol constitutes financial, investment, tax, or legal advice. Transaction evaluations are automated assessments, not recommendations. You are solely responsible for your financial decisions.

## 6. Your Responsibilities

- **Your keys, your responsibility.** You are responsible for securing your wallet credentials, recovery methods, and private keys.
- **Understanding the risks.** You understand blockchain transactions are irreversible and interact with experimental smart contracts.
- **Lawful use.** You will not use the Service for illegal activity, money laundering, or sanctions evasion.
- **Accurate information.** Information you provide (for account creation or otherwise) must be accurate.

## 7. Accounts & Authentication

- You may sign in via Google OAuth or connect a wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect).
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your authentication methods.
- One account per person. Don't share accounts.

## 8. Subscriptions & Payments

- A **free tier** is available (limited to the first 100 users).
- Paid plans are available at **$5/month** or **$50/year**.
- Pricing may change with reasonable notice.
- Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. Given the experimental nature of the Service, no refunds are guaranteed.

## 9. Service Availability

- The Service is provided **"as-is"** and **"as-available."**
- **The Service may be discontinued, modified, or interrupted at any time**, with or without notice.
- The Operator will make reasonable efforts to notify users of significant changes but is not obligated to maintain the Service indefinitely.

## 10. Intellectual Property

The Sigil Protocol platform, its code, design, and branding are the property of the Operator. Your on-chain assets and wallet contents remain yours.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

**To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Operator shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service.** This includes but is not limited to:

- Loss of funds or digital assets
- Incorrect transaction evaluations
- Smart contract failures or exploits
- Service downtime or discontinuation
- Third-party actions or blockchain network issues

**You use this Service entirely at your own risk.**

## 12. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Operator from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.

## 13. Termination

The Operator may suspend or terminate your access at any time, for any reason. You may stop using the Service at any time.

## 14. Changes to Terms

These Terms may be updated. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. Material changes will be communicated where feasible.
