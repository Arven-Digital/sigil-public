**Sigil Protocol — sigil.codes**
Last updated: February 12, 2026

---

## 1. Who We Are

Sigil Protocol is operated by an individual developer ("Operator") based in Turkey. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and what your rights are.

**Domains covered:** sigil.codes, app.sigil.codes, api.sigil.codes

## 2. What We Collect

We keep data collection **minimal** — only what's needed to operate the Service.

### Account Data
- **Email address** — from Google OAuth sign-in
- **Display name** — from Google profile
- **Profile picture** — Google avatar URL
- **Wallet addresses** — when you connect a wallet (MetaMask/WalletConnect)

### Transaction Data
- **Transaction details** submitted for AI guardian evaluation (recipient, value, calldata)
- **Evaluation results** — guardian decisions and risk scores
- This data is processed to provide the core security service.

### Technical Data
- **Authentication cookies** — httpOnly session cookies (not tracking cookies)
- **Basic server logs** — IP address, request timestamps, user agent (standard operational logs)

### What We Do NOT Collect
- Private keys or seed phrases (we never have access to these)
- Browsing history outside our platform
- Data from third-party trackers or analytics platforms

## 3. Why We Collect It

| Data | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Email, name, avatar | Account identification and authentication |
| Wallet addresses | Linking your wallets to your Sigil account |
| Transaction data | AI guardian evaluation (the core service) |
| Cookies | Maintaining your authenticated session |
| Server logs | Security, debugging, abuse prevention |

We do **not** sell your data. We do **not** use it for advertising.

## 4. Cookies

We use **functional cookies only**:

- **Authentication cookie** (httpOnly, secure) — keeps you logged in
- No tracking cookies, no analytics cookies, no third-party cookies

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties, except:

- **Google** — receives standard OAuth flow data when you sign in (governed by Google's privacy policy)
- **Blockchain networks** — transactions you submit are public on-chain by nature; this is inherent to blockchain, not a choice we make
- **Legal requirements** — if compelled by Turkish law or valid legal process

## 6. Data Storage & Security

- Data is stored on secured servers with reasonable security measures
- Authentication uses industry-standard practices (httpOnly cookies, OAuth 2.0)
- **However:** this is experimental software. While we take security seriously, no system is perfectly secure. See our Terms of Use.

## 7. Your Rights (GDPR-Friendly)

Regardless of where you're located, we respect the following rights:

- **Access** — Request a copy of your data
- **Correction** — Request correction of inaccurate data
- **Deletion** — Request deletion of your account and associated data
- **Data portability** — Request your data in a portable format
- **Withdraw consent** — Stop using the Service at any time

To exercise any of these rights, email us at hello@efe.observer. We will respond within 30 days.

**Note:** On-chain data (transactions, smart contract interactions) cannot be deleted as it exists on a public blockchain. This is a fundamental property of blockchain technology, not a limitation of our Service.

## 8. Data Retention

- Account data is retained while your account is active
- Upon account deletion, personal data is removed within 30 days
- Server logs are retained for up to 90 days for security purposes
- On-chain data persists indefinitely (blockchain is immutable)

## 9. Children

Sigil Protocol is not intended for anyone under **18 years of age**. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.

## 10. International Transfers

Your data may be processed on servers outside your country of residence. By using the Service, you consent to this transfer.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy. Material changes will be communicated where feasible. Continued use constitutes acceptance.

## 12. Governing Law

This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the **Republic of Turkey**.
